# {{ ydb-short-name }} for DevOps Engineers

This section of {{ ydb-short-name }} documentation covers everything you need to know to run a production-grade {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster. It is subdivided based on what's your preferred approach to managing infrastructure:

* **[Ansible](ansible/index.md)**: for deployments on bare metal and virtual machines.
* **[Kubernetes](kubernetes/index.md)**: for containerized deployments.
* **[Manual](manual/index.md)**: generic instructions.

Regardless of the chosen infrastructure management method, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with the [system requirements](system-requirements.md) and the list of main and additional [ports](../reference/ydb-ports.md) for {{ ydb-short-name }} before starting work.
